They had over 200,000 training records but no effective way to identify patterns or make data-driven decisions about workforce development. I built a system that processes this data and presents actionable insights through intuitive dashboards.",

The architecture includes role-based access layers allowing executives to see high-level metrics while team managers can drill down into specific areas relevant to their teams."

      "I've always been curious about how BitTorrent works, so I decided to build a torrent client from scratch. It required implementing everything from parsing torrent files to managing connections with peers and downloading file pieces in parallel, becoming a deep dive into networking and distributed systems principles.",
      "The most interesting part was developing the peer wire protocol implementation - how torrent clients communicate. I built a system that requests different pieces of a file from multiple peers simultaneously, verifies each piece with SHA1 hashing, and assembles them correctly. Seeing that first complete download finish was incredibly satisfying.",
      "I wrote it in Go, which was perfect due to its goroutines for concurrent operations. The client can download files quickly by intelligently prioritizing which pieces to download first and which peers to connect to. This project taught me more about practical networking than any course or book."
