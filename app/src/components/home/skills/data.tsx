 *   information including name, icon, description, repository links, and categories
 *
 * - databases: List of database technologies/platforms used
 *
 * - languages: Core programming languages proficiency

  "I've become quite fluent in JavaScript and TypeScript over the years. They're my go-to languages for most projects, and I love how they've evolved. React is where I spend most of time, building interfaces that people actually enjoy using.",

  "On the backend, I'm comfortable with Node.js and Express, but I've also ventured into Python with FastAPI and Django. I believe in choosing the right tool for the job — sometimes that's Go when performance really matters.",

  "Databases are my playground! From PostgreSQL for structured data to MongoDB when I need more flexibility. I've developed a weird appreciation for database optimization — there's something satisfying about a well-indexed query.",

  "Docker containers have changed how I build and deploy. Combined with some Kubernetes for orchestration, I can create environments that are consistent and scalable. That's been a game-changer for reliability.",

  "Right now, I'm diving deeper into vector databases and RAG patterns for AI applications. I'm always learning something new — currently exploring React Native for mobile development and fascinated by compiler design.",

  "My journey started with jQuery and PHP years ago, and I still appreciate what they taught me. Each technology I've worked with has added something valuable to my approach to problem-solving.",
