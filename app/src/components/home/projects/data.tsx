    "I built DocTracker to solve a problem I frequently encountered: keeping track of my progress when reading through large documentation sets or technical books.

    "The core of the application is the reading analytics engine. It tracks precisely which sections you've read, how long you spent on them, and estimates how many words you've covered. This data feeds into various visualizations that help you understand your reading patterns ‚Äì like whether you read more on weekends, which times of day you're most active, or which categories you've explored most thoroughly.",

    "I'm particularly proud of the reading journey visualization, which shows your progress over time with milestone markers for significant achievements. It creates a motivating experience that turns documentation reading from a chore into something more engaging.",

    "On the technical side, I built this with React and TypeScript, using Zustand for state management. The persistent storage uses IndexedDB to track all your reading data locally. For visualizations, I used Recharts with custom components for specialized displays like heat maps and radar charts. The document processing system breaks markdown content into navigable sections and tracks completion at a granular level.",

    "I built GEP to solve a frustrating problem I encountered regularly: searching through large codebases. Traditional tools like grep are great for exact pattern matching, but they fall short when you're trying to find code by concept or functionality, especially in unfamiliar codebases.",

    "What makes GEP different is its ability to understand code semantically. Instead of just matching text patterns, it uses vector embeddings to understand the meaning and purpose of code. This means you can search with natural language like 'how does the authentication system work?' and get relevant results even if those exact words don't appear in the code.",

    "The architecture combines several advanced technologies: code is processed and embedded using language models, stored in vector databases for efficient similarity search, and then retrieved and analyzed when needed. I implemented file monitoring to keep the index up-to-date as code changes, and integrated with Git to provide context around when and why code evolved.",

    "One of the most satisfying aspects was building the semantic search capability. By generating embeddings for code chunks and queries, the tool can find conceptually similar code regardless of specific syntax or naming conventions. The challenge was balancing embedding granularity - too small and you lose context, too large and you lose precision.",

    "The project taught me a lot about working with vector databases, prompt engineering for code analysis, and building maintainable CLI applications.

I also integrated Immer which lets you write code that looks like you're directly modifying state (which is more intuitive) while still keeping the immutability benefits behind the scenes.",

I basically built a system that could process all that data and show them what was actually happening with their workforce development.",

It cut analysis time from days to just minutes.",

    "I built Smash LeetCode to address the challenges I personally faced when preparing for technical interviews. While practicing algorithmic problems, I found that existing platforms often lacked the depth of explanation and visualization tools needed to truly understand complex algorithms. I wanted to create a learning environment that not only tests your coding ability but actually teaches you the underlying concepts through interactive visuals and AI-powered guidance.",

    "The feature I'm most proud of is the algorithm visualization system, which transforms abstract code into animated, step-by-step visual representations. This makes it much easier to understand how algorithms like graph traversals or dynamic programming actually work. I put considerable effort into designing the visualization engine to handle different data structures elegantly - from arrays and linked lists to trees and graphs.",

    "The AI coaching component was another significant challenge. I integrated large language models with custom prompts to create contextual hints that guide without spoiling solutions. The system analyzes your code in real-time, identifying potential optimizations and explaining complex concepts in an approachable way. It's designed to simulate having a patient mentor who helps you think through problems rather than just giving you answers.",

    "From a technical perspective, I learned a tremendous amount about full-stack development with modern technologies. The frontend uses React 19 with TypeScript for a responsive, type-safe user experience, while the backend leverages FastAPI and SQLAlchemy for high-performance API endpoints. The project also gave me valuable experience integrating AI capabilities through LangChain and handling complex state management across a feature-rich application.",
